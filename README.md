# Cryptocurrency Mixers: Self-Designed Protocol

This repository contains the implementation of a self-designed cryptocurrency mixer protocol aimed at enhancing privacy and anonymity in digital currency transactions.

## Overview

Cryptocurrency mixers, or tumblers, obfuscate the origins of transactions to ensure privacy. This project explores the design and implementation of a novel mixer protocol using advanced cryptographic techniques.

## Features

- **Blind Signatures**: Ensures unlinkability between deposits and withdrawals.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Validates transactions without revealing details.
- **CoinJoin Protocol**: Combines multiple transactions to obfuscate transaction trails.
- **Decentralized**: Eliminates the need for a trusted third party.

## Protocol Design

- **Deposit**: Users deposit cryptocurrency into the mixer's smart contract.
- **Certificate of Deposit (CD)**: Generated and signed to ensure anonymity.
- **Withdrawal**: Users withdraw funds using their CD, maintaining privacy.

## Implementation

The protocol is implemented in Solidity and includes:

- **Mixer Contract**: Manages deposits, issuance of CDs, and withdrawals.
- **Helper Functions**: Handles cryptographic operations off-chain to reduce gas fees.

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

The use of cryptocurrency mixers has both ethical and legal implications, particularly concerning financial privacy and potential misuse for illicit activities.
